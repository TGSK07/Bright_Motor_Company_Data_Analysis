## ü§ñ Model: Ridge Regression

* **Input Features**: `Age`, `Education`, and `No_of_Dependents`
* **Target Variable**: `Salary`
* **Model Used**: Ridge Regression (`alpha=0.4`)

### üî¢ Model Results:

* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: 7165.657
* **Normalized RMSE**: 0.121

### üìå Insight:

* The normalized RMSE of 0.121 indicates the model performs **reasonably well** in predicting salaries based on the provided features, with relatively low error compared to the salary range.
